I’m a Master’s student in Applied Data Science at USC with hands-on experience building end-to-end machine learning solutions across LLM evaluation, computer vision, and recommender systems. My work focuses on translating complex modeling problems into scalable, data-driven products with measurable business impact.

With a background in business analytics and industry experience at Fusion AI and M-Joys Tech, I’ve developed and optimized models using Python and SQL — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to experimentation and performance evaluation. I’m particularly interested in applied machine learning and product-oriented data science roles where I can combine quantitative rigor, experimentation, and business context to drive informed decision-making and user-centered outcomes.
