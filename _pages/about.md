I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California (USC), where I focus on building data-driven solutions with real-world impact. I’m passionate about leveraging data science to solve meaningful problems and aim to work in roles that combine machine learning, analytics, and product thinking.

I’ve contributed to projects involving LLM evaluation, image classification, and recommender systems, and have interned as a Data Scientist at companies like Fusion AI and M-Joys Tech. I’m now actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning to drive insights and build user-centered, intelligent solutions.
